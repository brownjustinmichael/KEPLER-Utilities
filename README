Installation:

Be sure to install the following python packages somewhere where your python distribution can see them:
	-numpy
	-astropy
	-pandas
	-matplotlib
	-sqlalchemy (If interested in using database.py and update_db.py)
	-celery (If interested in using generate.py and kepler_jobs.py)

I recommend Python 3.4, but let me know if another version isn't working.

USAGE
-----
Database:

To make a database of all KEPLER dump files in a directory and all its subdirectories:

python /path/to/update_db.py

This database can be accessed with SQLAlchemy as in plot_cores.py

Plotting:

These are example scripts for use and should be modified as desired.

To plot the abundance profile of a given dump file:
python plot_abundances.py name_of_dump_file [name_of_output_file]

To plot a Kippenhahn diagram for a given cnv file:
python plot_kipp.py name_of_cnv_file [name_of_output_file]

To learn how to query the database and plot a bunch of cached quantities, look at plot_cores.py
